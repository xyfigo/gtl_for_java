/**
 * Models an OGC-style <code>LineString</code>.
 * A LineString consists of a sequence of two or more vertices,
 * along with all points along the linearly-interpolated curves
 * (line segments) between each
 * pair of consecutive vertices.
 * Consecutive vertices may be equal.
 * The line segments in the line may intersect each other (in other words,
 * the linestring may "curl back" in itself and self-intersect.
 * Linestrings with exactly two identical points are invalid.
 * <p>
 * A linestring must have either 0 or 2 or more points.
 * If these conditions are not met, the constructors throw
 * an {@link IllegalArgumentException}
