/**
 * Created by hadoop on 17-3-26.
 * If A, B, C are three non-collinear points, the plane ABC is
 * the set of all points collinear with pairs of points on one
 * or two sides of the triangle ABC.
 * a plane is uniquely determined by any of the following data:
 * 1)by three non-collinear points,
 * 2)by two straight lines meeting one another,
 * 3)by a straight line and a point not on that line, and
 * 4)a point and a line perpendicular to the plane.
 * Thus, there are many ways to represent a plane P. Some methods
 * work in any dimension, and some work only in 3D. In any dimension,
 * one can always specify 3 non-collinear points V0=(x0,y0,z0),
 * V1=(x1,y1,z1), V2=(x2,y2,z2) as the vertices of a triangle,
 * the most primitive planar object.
 * In 3D, this uniquely defines the plane of points P=(x,y,z)
 * satisfying the implicit equation:
 * |x -x0  y -y0 z- z0|
 * |x1-x0  y1-y0 z1-z0|=0
 * |x2-x0  y2-y0 z2-z0|
 * represented as a determinant.
 * In 3 dimensions, another popular and useful representation for
 * a plane P is the normal form that specifies an origin point V0
 * on P and a “normal” vector n which is perpendicular to P .
 * This representation is useful for computing intersections,
 * resulting in compact and efficient formulas.
 * But, this representation only works in 3D space.
 * In a higher n-dimensional space,
 * this representation defines an (n–1)-dimensional linear subspace.
 * We will not pursue this further here except to say that many of
 * the results for planes in 3D carry over to hyperplanes of n-D space
 * (see [Hanson, 1994] for further information).
 * In 3D, a normal vector n for P can be computed from any triangle V0V1V2 of points
 * on P   as the cross-product n=u x v=...
 * Then, any point P on the plane satisfies the normal implicit equation:
 * n.(P-V0)=0
 * For n=(a,b,c), P=(x,y,z) and d = –(n · V0), the equation for the plane is:
 * n.(P-V0)=ax+by+cz+d=0
 * So, the xyz-coefficients (a,b,c) of any linear equation for a plane P
 * always give a vector which is perpendicular to the plane.
 * Also, when d = 0, the plane passes through the origin 0 = (0,0,0).
 * It is often useful to have a unit normal vector for the plane
 * which simplifies some formulas. This is easily done by dividing n by |n|.
 * Then, the associated implicit equation ax+by+cz+d=0 is said to
 * be “normalized”. Further, when |n| = 1,
 * the coordinates (a,b,c) of n are also the direction cosines of
 * the angles that the vector n makes with the xyz-axes.
 * Additionally, d is then the perpendicular distance from the origin
 * 0 to the plane, as we will show in the next section.
